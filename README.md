# Visualizations

I created *vizzy* to post examples of visualizations that I am developing.
Typically these examples will be simplified versions of the ultimate visualizations
to help me fine tune features.
This should also make it easier for others to grab and modify the code to suit their own needs.

## github markdown cheatsheet

I created this README.md file using markdown, which is new to me.
I found this 
[markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) 
extremely helpful.
