# Visualizations

I created **vizzy** to post examples of visualizations as I am developing them.
Typically these examples will be simplified versions of the ultimate visualizations as I fine tune features.
This should also make it easier for others to grab and modify the code to suit their own needs.

### markdown

I created this README.md file using markdown and this 
[markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) 
which was very helpful.
