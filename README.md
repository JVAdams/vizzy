This is my first attempt at writing a README file using Github markdown.
==============

Visualizations
--------------

I don't know thing one about *github*, I just wanted a place where I could post visualizations
to the web without putting up with the typical 
- headers, 
- footers, 
- margins, 
- **clutter** 
of free webhosting sites.

I'm also in the process of learning D3.js, and wanted a place to
	post some
	code
	(playing with markdown now)

How's that for a start?
